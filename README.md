# Quantum Machine Learning Project

This project contains a series of Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts in quantum machine learning. The scripts are named `Part_a.py` through `Part_f.py`, each covering a different topic.

## Scripts

- [`Part_a.py`](Part_a.py): This script demonstrates the application of quantum gates and measurements. It includes functions for applying gates to qubits, creating Bell states, and measuring the resulting states.

- [`Part_b.py`](Part_b.py): This script focuses on the construction and manipulation of Hamiltonian matrices. It includes functions for setting up the Hamiltonian, computing eigenvalues and entropies, and running the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm.

- [`Part_c.py`](Part_c.py): (Description of what `Part_c.py` does)

- [`Part_d.py`](Part_d.py): (Description of what `Part_d.py` does)

- [`Part_e.py`](Part_e.py): (Description of what `Part_e.py` does)

- [`Part_f.py`](Part_f.py): (Description of what `Part_f.py` does)

## Usage

To run a script, use the following command:

```sh
python3 Part_a.py

Replace Part_a.py with the name of the script you want to run.

Requirements:
These scripts require Python 3 and the following Python libraries:

Qiskit
NumPy
Matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:
``pip install qiskit numpy matplotlib``
